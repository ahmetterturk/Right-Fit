A crucial nuance of doing exercise and fitness activities is to maintain consistancy and transform it into a life style. How many of us, in some part of our lives were determined to make the change and improve our overall life quality? Have started exercising, or signed up to gym, or started a team sport and was able to keep it up? Studies show that January is the most lucrative month for fitness centers. A lot of the people start a gym membership, because they want to completely redefine themselves. Google searches for health and fitness peak at the beginning of the year, and according to the 2017 IHRSA Media Report, 10.8% of all health club members join their gyms in January. Yet many who embark on fitness resolutions in the new year struggle to stick with their new habit, and more than 90% of these people will quit after three months of going to the gym. 

There are many reasons behind not being able to commit to exercising. Some are usually very busy on their daily routines and just could not find the time for excersice. Some find sports activities to be unenjoyable. Some people may find it intimidating to walk into a gym where everyone is fit and may think they stand out. Some people find gyms too complicated with all the exercise machines and don't know where to start. The problem that is aimed to be resolved by building this marketplace is to help people continue exercising and pursue their dream of living a healthy lifestyle.
