## R7-Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
Physical activity and exercise are proven to be crucial for the quality of life that we live. Exercise not only impacts our body, but it also helps us with a healthier state of mind. Some of the physical benefits of exercise and fitness include reduced risk of heart attacks, lower blood cholesterol levels, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and gives the person control of their weight preventing obesity. The mental benefits of exercise include blocking out negative thoughts, distraction you from daily stress, provides opportunity for social contact when exercising with others, increased lift in mood, improved sleeping patterns and also exercise changes the levels of chemicals in the brain that such as serotonin, endorphins and stress hormones.  

A crucial nuance of doing exercise and fitness activities is to maintain consistancy and transform it into a life style. How many of us, in some part of our lives were determined to make the change and improve our overall life quality? Have started exercising, or signed up to gym, or started a team sport and was able to keep it up? Studies show that January is the most lucrative month for fitness centers. A lot of the people start a gym membership, because they want to completely redefine themselves. Google searches for health and fitness peak at the beginning of the year, and according to the 2017 IHRSA Media Report, 10.8% of all health club members join their gyms in January. Yet many who embark on fitness resolutions in the new year struggle to stick with their new habit, and more than 90% of these people will quit after three months of going to the gym. 

There are many reasons behind not being able to commit to exercising. Some are usually very busy on their daily routines and just could not find the time for excersice. Some find sports activities to be unenjoyable. Some people may find it intimidating to walk into a gym where everyone is fit and may think they stand out. Some people find gyms too complicated with all the exercise machines and don't know where to start. The problem that is aimed to be resolved by building this marketplace is to help people continue exercising and pursue their dream of living a healthy lifestyle. 

## R8-Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Physical inactivity can have serious implications for peopleâ€™s health. According to World Health Organization's data, approximately 2 million deaths per year are attributed to physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle and could very well be among the 10 leading causes of death and disability in the world. Sedentary lifestyles increase all causes of mortality, double the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity, and increase the risks of colon cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression and anxiety. According to WHO, 60 to 85% of people in the world from both developed and developing countries lead sedentary lifestyles, making it one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time. It is estimated that nearly two thirds of children are also insufficiently active, with serious implications for their future health.
